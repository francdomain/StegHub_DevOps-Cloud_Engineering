# Networking Concepts Documentation

## 1. IP Address

An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network. It enables devices to locate and communicate with each other over an IP-based network like the internet.

-	IPv4 Address: A 32-bit number typically written in dotted decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.1.1), consisting of four octets.
-	IPv6 Address: A 128-bit number written in hexadecimal and separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334), designed to replace IPv4 due to address exhaustion.


## 2. Subnets

A subnet (short for subnetwork) is a logical subdivision of an IP network. Subnetting divides a large network into smaller, manageable pieces, improving performance and security.

-	Subnet Mask: A 32-bit number used to distinguish the network portion of an IP address from the host portion. For example, the subnet mask 255.255.255.0 with an IP address of 192.168.1.1 means the network address is 192.168.1.0, and the host address is 1.
-	Subnetting: The process of dividing a network into smaller subnets. This can help in efficient IP address management and better network performance.


## 3. CIDR Notation

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation is a compact representation of an IP address and its associated network mask.

-	Format: An IP address followed by a slash and a number (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).
-	Slash Notation: The number after the slash represents the number of bits used for the network portion of the address. In the example above, /24 means the first 24 bits are the network part, corresponding to a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0.


## 4. IP Routing

IP routing is the process of forwarding packets from one network to another using routers. Routers determine the best path for data packets to travel based on routing tables and algorithms.

-	Routing Table: A data table stored in a router or a networked computer that lists the routes to particular network destinations.
-	Static Routing: Manually configured routes that do not change unless updated by an administrator.
-	Dynamic Routing: Automatically adjusted routes using routing protocols like OSPF, BGP, and EIGRP to adapt to network changes.


## 5. Internet Gateways

An internet gateway is a network node that connects a local network to the internet, allowing internal devices to access external networks and vice versa.

-	Functionality: Acts as a router and firewall, managing traffic between the internal network and the internet, performing Network Address Translation (NAT) if necessary.
-	Usage in Cloud: In cloud environments like AWS, an internet gateway enables instances within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to communicate with the internet.


## 6. Network Address Translation (NAT)

NAT is a technique used to map private IP addresses within a local network to a single public IP address, allowing multiple devices to share a single IP address for internet access.

-	Types of NAT:
	-	Static NAT: One-to-one mapping between a private IP address and a public IP address.
	-	Dynamic NAT: Maps a private IP address to a public IP address from a pool of available public addresses.
	-	PAT (Port Address Translation): Also known as NAT Overload, it maps multiple private IP addresses to a single public IP address using different ports.
-	Benefits:
	•	Conserves public IP addresses.
	•	Enhances security by hiding internal IP addresses.
	•	Enables private IP addresses to communicate with external networks.


## Summary

Understanding these networking concepts is fundamental for managing and configuring networks efficiently. `IP addresses` uniquely identify devices, `subnets` organize network traffic, CIDR notation simplifies IP address representation, IP routing ensures data reaches its destination, `internet gateways` connect local networks to the internet, and `NAT` optimizes IP address usage and enhances security. These concepts collectively form the backbone of modern networking, enabling seamless communication across diverse and distributed systems.
